   <p>
	words
    <br>
	are 
    <br>
	birds
	<br>
	that 
    <br>
	arrive
	<br>
	with 
    <br>
	books
	<br>
	and 
    <br>
	spring
	<br>
	they
	<br>
	love
	<br>
	clouds
	<br>
	the 
    <br>
	wind
	<br>
	and 
    <br>
	trees
	<br>
  	some 
    <br>
  	words
  	<br>
	are 
    <br>
	messengers
	<br>
	that 
    <br>
	come
	<br>
	from 
    <br>
	far 
    <br>
	away
	<br>
	from 
    <br>
	distant 
    <br>
	lands
	<br>
	for 
    <br>
	them
	<br>
	there 
    <br>
	are
	<br>
	no 
    <br>
	borders
	<br>
	only 
    <br>
	stars
	<br>
	moon 
    <br>
	and 
    <br>
	sun
	<br>
	some 
    <br>
	words
	<br>
	are familiar
	<br>
	like canaries
	<br>
	others are exotic
	<br>
	like the quetzal bird
	<br>
	some can stand
	<br>
	the cold
	<br>
	others 
    <br>
	migrate
	<br>
	with 
    <br>
	the 
    <br>
	sun
	<br>
	to 
    <br>
	the 
    <br>
	south
	<br>
	some 
    <br>
	words
	<br>
	die
	<br>
	cagedâ€”
	<br>
	they're 
    <br>
	difficult
	<br>
	to 
    <br>
	translate
	<br>
	and 
    <br>
	others
	<br>
	build 
    <br>
	nests
	<br>
	have 
    <br>
	chicks
	<br>
	warm them
	<br>
	feed them
	<br>
	teach them
	<br>
	how to fly
	<br>
	and 
    <br>
	one 
    <br>
	day
	<br>
	they 
    <br>
	go 
    <br>
	away
	<br>
	in 
    <br>
	flocks
	<br>
	the 
    <br>
	letters
	<br>
	on 
    <br>
	this 
    <br>
	page
	<br>
	are 
    <br>
	the 
    <br>
	prints
	<br>
	they 
    <br>
	leave
	<br>
	by 
    <br>
	the 
    <br>
	sea
