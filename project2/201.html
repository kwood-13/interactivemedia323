  <h1>words are birds that arrive with books and spring</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>they love clouds the wind and trees</h2>
  <h3>some words are messengers that come from far away from distant lands</h3>
  <h2>for the there are no borders only stars moon and sun</h2>
  <br><br>
  <h4>some words are familiar like canaries other are exotic like the quetzal bird</h4>
  <h5>some words die cagedâ€” they're difficult to translate</h5>
  <h2>and others build nests have chicks warm them feed them</h2>
  <h6>teach them how to fly and one day they go away in flocks</h6>

  <h3>the letters on this page are the prints they leave by the sea</h3>
