  <p>
	words
	are birds
	that arrive
	with books
	and spring
	they
	love
	clouds
	the wind
	and trees
  	some words
	are messengers
	that come
	from far away
	from distant lands
	for them
	there are
	no borders
	only stars
	moon and sun
	some words
	are familiar
	like canaries
	others are exotic
	like the quetzal bird
	some can stand
	the cold
	others migrate
	with the sun
	to the south
	some words
	die
	caged—
	they're difficult
	to translate
	and others
	build nests
	have chicks
	warm them
	feed them
	teach them
	how to fly
	and one day
	they go away
	in flocks
	the letters
	on this page
	are the prints
	they leave
	by the sea
