	words
    <br>
	are birds
	<br>
	that arrive
	<br>
	with books
	<br>
	and spring
	<br>
	they
	<br>
	love
	<br>
	clouds
	<br>
	the wind
	<br>
	and trees
	<br>
  	some words
  	<br>
	are messengers
	<br>
	that come
	<br>
	from far away
	<br>
	from distant lands
	<br>
	for them
	<br>
	there are
	<br>
	no borders
	<br>
	only stars
	<br>
	moon and sun
	<br>
	some words
	<br>
	are familiar
	<br>
	like canaries
	<br>
	others are exotic
	<br>
	like the quetzal bird
	<br>
	some can stand
	<br>
	the cold
	<br>
	others migrate
	<br>
	with the sun
	<br>
	to the south
	<br>
	some words
	<br>
	die
	<br>
	cagedâ€”
	<br>
	they're difficult
	<br>
	to translate
	<br>
	and others
	<br>
	build nests
	<br>
	have chicks
	<br>
	warm them
	<br>
	feed them
	<br>
	teach them
	<br>
	how to fly
	<br>
	and one day
	<br>
	they go away
	<br>
	in flocks
	<br>
	the letters
	<br>
	on this page
	<br>
	are the prints
	<br>
	they leave
	<br>
	by the sea
